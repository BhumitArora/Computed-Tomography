# Computed-Tomography

Computed Tomography(CT), refers to a computerized x-ray imaging procedure in which a narrow beam of x-rays is aimed at a patient and quickly rotated around the body, producing signals that are processed by the machine’s computer to generate cross-sectional images, or “slices.

In this project I tried to implement the process behind ct scan in python and tested the model using real data.
